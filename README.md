## About the Project

This project was part of our 10-month long Full-Stack Developer course at [Codecool](https://codecool.com/), where we could showcase our frontend skills until that point. The goal of this project was to create a React web application that makes it easier to look up information about characters and locations from the _Rick and Morty_ universe. We also tried to make it more fun with some easter eggs (for true fans!). We utilized an open-source [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to fetch the required data.

### Used Technologies

* Javascript
* Node.js
* React.js
* React Router

## Getting Started

You'll need the Node Package Manager (`npm`) installed on your computer. To install the dependencies, type the following command into your terminal from the root directory of the project:
```sh
npm install
```
When the insatallation finished, you can start the application with this command:
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Have fun looking around!
